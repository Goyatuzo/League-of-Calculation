League of Legends Damage Calculator
===================================
Select two champions, one dealing damage, and one taking the damage. Once the champions are selected,
choose the items they will have and this application will compute a rough estimate of the damage
you will can inflict on the enemy.

Stopping work on this because there is just simply too many variables to consider when trying to calculate the damage models in League of Legends. I may come back to this in the future on a simplified version of the original idea.
